    Human Rights
  </h1>

  <p>
    Human rights in North Korea are severely limited. there is no right to free speech, and the only radio, television, 
    music and news providers that are deemed legal are those operated by the government. An estimated 80,000–120,000 prisoners 
    are incarcerated in camps that are dedicated to political crimes, and are subject to forced labor, physical abuse and execution. 
    <br/>
    On the basis of these abuses, as well as persecution on political, religious, racial and gender grounds, forcible transfer
    of populations, enforced disappearance of persons and forced starvation, the United Nations Commission of Inquiry 
    has accused North Korea of crimes against humanity. </p>

  <h1> Finally, Economy!! </h1>
  <font color = "#131442" face = "Segoe Script"/>
  <p> Although there have been some small-scale reforms, as of 2015, 
    North Korea continues its basic adherence to a rigid centrally planned economy, 
    and its reliance on fundamentally non-pecuniary (not readily quantified or valued in money) incentives.
    There have been reports of economic reform, particularly after Kim Jong-un assumed the leadership in 2012,
    but recent reports conflict over particular legislation and enactment. 
    China represents 57% of North Korea’s imports and 42% of exports North Korean Won’s are 0.020 Egyptian Pound. </p>
